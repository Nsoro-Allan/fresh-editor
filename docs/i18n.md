# Internationalization

Fresh supports multiple languages for its user interface. The editor automatically detects your system locale, but you can also set your preferred language manually.

## Supported Languages

See the [`locales/`](https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/tree/master/crates/fresh-editor/locales) directory for the full list of supported languages. Each `.json` file represents a supported locale (e.g., `en.json` for English, `es.json` for Spanish, `ja.json` for Japanese).

## Setting Your Language

You can configure your preferred language in `~/.config/fresh/config.json`:

```json
{
  "locale": "es"
}
```

Or use the Settings UI (**Edit → Settings...**) and navigate to the **General** section to select your language.

## Plugin Translations

Plugins can provide their own translations. Plugins that support i18n use your configured locale automatically. Translations are stored in `.i18n.json` files alongside the plugin.
