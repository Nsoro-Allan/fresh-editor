# File Explorer

Fresh includes a built-in file explorer.

*   **Toggle Sidebar:** Use `Ctrl+B` to show/hide the file explorer sidebar.
*   **Focus:** Use `Ctrl+E` to switch focus between the file explorer and editor.
*   **Navigation:** Use the arrow keys to move up and down the file tree.
*   **Open Files:** Press `Enter` to open the selected file and focus the editor. Single-click opens a file but keeps focus on the explorer; double-click opens and focuses the editor.
*   **Gitignore Support:** The file explorer respects your `.gitignore` file, hiding ignored files by default.
